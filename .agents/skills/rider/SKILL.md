description: "Use when working on THE RIDER — the man on the saddle: how he is posed on the deck (the hands on the grips, the feet in the footwells, the stand-up's crouch), how his body answers the inputs and the hull (the lean, the hang into a turn, the tuck into the wind, the throttle's shove, a landing taken in the knees), and how he looks from behind at chase range. Owns pwa/src/game/rider-pose.ts (the pose as DOM-free maths, the body on springs) and rider.ts (the figure), `cockpitOf` in craft-body.ts as what he stands on, tests/rider_test.ts, and the loop: `make crafts` (he is on every sheet, at rest), then the built app at `SCENE=rest`, `cruise`, `carve`, `landing`."

# The rider

The rider is the one human thing in the frame, and the chase camera looks
at his back for the whole run. He is **generated from the deck and the
engine's readings**, never animated by hand: `rider-pose.ts` places every
joint from the craft's cockpit and a `RiderRead`, and `rider.ts` re-emits
the figure from those joints every frame into one vertex-coloured mesh.

**Before starting, read this skill's lessons** —
`node scripts/skill-lessons.mjs rider --list`. Load `skill-reflection` at
both ends, `write-code` beside this for any code change, and
`craft-design` when the deck he sits on is what moves.

## Where everything lives

| Piece | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `pwa/src/game/rider-pose.ts` | `RIDER_SCALE` (how big he is DRAWN), `BODY` (an anthropometric table's segments for a 1.8 m man, each carrying that scale), `STANCE` (the lean at idle, what the throttle and pace add, how far the pelvis slides and how wide the feet stand, how the head follows), `DYNAMICS` (the springs: pitch, roll, crush), `HAUL` (righting a capsized hull from the saddle: which way he throws his weight, how hard, and the rock), `poseRider(cockpit, read)` → every joint, `createRiderDynamics()` → the springs stepped per engine step, `riderHaul` |
| `pwa/src/game/rider.ts` | `createRider(cockpit, surface?)`: the figure — the seat and hips as one mass leaning with the torso, the vest's lighter back and two orange straps, the full-face helmet in three bands of livery under a peak, muscled arms to the grips, the two-tone thighs, the orange shin stripe, the boots — and `observe` / `update` / `pose`. `FACETS` is the roundness dial and `k()` carries `RIDER_SCALE` into every girth. `RIDER_FINISH` says what each `PAINT` is finished in (`FINISH`, craft-surface.ts): the shell and the visor flare, the wet skin and neoprene carry a sheen, the vest's nylon does not — he is drawn on the craft's own surface, so the sun and the sky land on him as they land on the hull |
| `pwa/src/game/craft-body.ts` | `cockpitOf(spec, style)`: the saddle's bucket, the grips, the footwells, from the same `layout` the hull loft reads — the rider reaches what is drawn |
| `pwa/src/game/renderer.ts` | Builds the rider with the craft and adds his mesh to the craft's group; `observe` steps his springs, `render` poses him |
| `scripts/craft-preview.mjs` | `make crafts` — he is on every craft on the sheet, at rest, with a `helmet` column beside `bars` |
| `tests/rider_test.ts` | The pose held to the deck on every craft; the inputs moving the body the way they mean; the springs on a landing |

## How he is posed

1. The pelvis goes on the seat (`seat.y + BODY.pelvis`, toward the front
   of the bucket), or over the tray at a crouch on a stand-up.
2. The torso leans forward by `STANCE.seatedLean` plus the throttle's and
   the pace's share, minus the rider's lean back, plus the springs' pitch;
   it rolls into a turn by `riderRight`.
3. The hands are ON THE GRIPS. Each arm is solved back from its grip
   (`solveLimb`, the elbow hanging down at a reach and winging OUT as the
   arm folds). **The reach is bounded BOTH ways.** If a shoulder cannot
   reach, the torso leans further, and at full lean the pelvis slides up
   the bucket (`seat.zMax`) — so a rider leaning back sits with straight
   arms, the way a real one does, the torso angle barely changing. If a
   shoulder comes CLOSER to its grip than `STANCE.reachMin` of the arm's
   length, the torso stands back up: leaning forward pitches the torso and
   slides the pelvis forward at once, which walks the shoulders onto the
   bars, and an arm folded past an elbow's own limit collapses back through
   the shoulder and disappears inside the vest.
4. The feet stand on the footwell floor ahead of the pelvis; the knees are
   solved up and in beside the saddle (forward, stood).
5. The head follows a share of the torso's lean and turns into the turn.

Everything deliberate is a `CraftState` field the engine wrote
(`riderAft`, `riderRight`, `throttleEff`, `speed`); nothing re-derives
intent. The involuntary part is `createRiderDynamics`: three damped
springs at a human's postural frequencies, driven by the hull's surge, its
vertical acceleration (differenced `vy` — free fall lifts him off the
seat, a slam compresses him) and the CHANGE in its pitch and roll rates
(the lag), plus a lurch on `hit` and `ground`. Stepped in `observe` with
the engine's dt, so a pre-rolled screenshot shows the same body.

## The loop

1. `make crafts` — the sheet, all four craft, at rest. Judge the STERN and
   CHASE cells first (that is the game's view), then SIDE for the lean and
   the reach: arms at full stretch at rest mean the grips are out of reach
   (`tests/rider_test.ts` holds the reach; it fails before the picture
   does).
   **That sheet is `REST_READ` and nothing else, so it cannot show a POSE
   fault at all.** A change to `STANCE`, to the reach or to a limb's solve
   is judged off a grid of READS — a scratch script that poses
   `createRider` over a spread of `RiderRead`s (both lean axes at their
   `TUNING.rider` reaches, the tuck, the stand, the springs at their stops)
   and paints it the way `scripts/craft-preview.mjs` does. Size each cell to
   the craft's own footprint in that view plus a gutter, or the views bleed
   into one another and hide the very fault you are looking for.
2. A pose change is a `STANCE` number; a body change is `BODY`; a look
   change is `PAINT` or a `segment` in `figure`. One axis, re-sheet, look.
3. `make build`, then `CHROMIUM_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium make
   screenshots SCENE=rest`, `cruise`, `carve`, `landing` — a bright seed
   (19 is a clear late morning) — and crop the craft at 3× to judge; at
   1280 px he is sixty pixels tall and a pose reads only as a silhouette.
4. `make profile`: he is one draw call and about 1700 triangles — half a
   percent of the frame — so roundness is cheap and being ONE mesh is the
   invariant that matters, not the count.

## Judging him

- **From behind, at sixty pixels, he must read as a man on a machine**:
  the helmet, the shoulders, the back a lighter tone than the saddle, the
  straps, the arms out to the bars. Contrast does the work, not detail.
- **Hands on the grips, boots on the floor, always.** A hand floating off
  a grip is the first thing a player sees.
- **The body answers the hull.** Open the throttle: he goes back, then
  tucks. Turn: he hangs in and looks through it. A wave: the knees and the
  back take it, then settle. Nothing snaps — every motion is a spring or
  the engine's own lag.
- **Proportions are the table's; only the SCALE is a choice.** `BODY` is
  an anthropometric 1.8 m man (upper arm 0.31, forearm 0.27 + the fist,
  thigh 0.44, shin 0.42, shoulders 0.42 apart) with every segment
  multiplied by `RIDER_SCALE` — over one on purpose, because a correctly
  sized man on a correctly sized 3 m runabout reads as a child on a boat
  at chase range, and the reference draws its riders big. Move the scale
  to change how big he is; never a single segment. Fix a REACH at the deck
  or the stance, never by lengthening an arm.
- **Girth is silhouette.** Nothing is textured and nothing is
  smooth-shaded, so a limb is read from its outline: a segment lofted as
  an even taper reads as tubing however it is painted. Every limb is a
  wide joint, a wider muscle belly at the anatomical place, then a narrow
  joint — and the contrast between belly and joint is what carries the
  tone, not the absolute girth.

## What is not here yet

The rider THROWN — he is never off the machine (a capsize keeps him in the
saddle, turned over with it, throwing his weight at the side the hull has
to come back toward: `riderHaul` and `HAUL` in rider-pose.ts); nothing
draws a man in the water, and the `wipeout` subject is reserved. Also a
second rider, a woman, a helmet without a peak. Bars that turn with the
steer would move his hands with them; today the bars are static geometry
and the hands stay on them.

## Skill self-improvement

Load **`skill-reflection`** before this session commits. Worth recording
here: a stance number that fixed a read at chase range, a reach that a
deck change broke, a spring gain that read as a twitch.
