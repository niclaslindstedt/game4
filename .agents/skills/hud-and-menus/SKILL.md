# The HUD and the controls: what the player reads and presses

Everything on screen during a RUN that is not the world. Two surfaces, one
rule: the
**decision is DOM-free, the DOM only renders it**. A payload module works out
what to show — the numbers, the framing, what a drag MEANS — and a `.tsx`
component draws it. That split is why the root vitest suite can test the
throttle lever's gesture without a browser (`tests/input_model_test.ts`), and
it is the first thing to preserve in any change here.

**Read this skill's lessons first** — `node scripts/skill-lessons.mjs
hud-and-menus --list`. Load **`skill-reflection`** at both ends, **`write-code`**
beside this one, and **`ui-review`** for the fit-and-finish sweep at the
reference viewports. For what a readout MEANS (the wind vane's promise, the
air time as a moment) load `game-feel`.

**The CARDS are next door.** The attract screen, the front door and its
START / OPTIONS / DEVELOPER rows, the loading card, and everything the game
remembers between visits (`settings.ts`) are **`menu-system`** — load that
one instead. The split is what is up: this skill owns what is drawn over a
run in progress, that one owns the shell around it. They share the payload
rule above, and `input.ts` sits on the seam — the keys that ride a craft are
here, the keys that walk a card are there.

## The HUD

| Surface | Where |
| --- | --- |
| The readouts: speed (km/h, big), the rpm bar (no gear — a PWC has none), the run clock, gate `n / N`, the last split, the air time while airborne, the build label in the corner | `pwa/src/game/hud.tsx` + `pwa/src/styles.css` |
| A moving instrument, dial or bar, as a component | `pwa/src/game/hud-dial.tsx` — the altitude tape, wind meter and rpm bar are here; a temperature or a fuel gauge, when they come, are others |
| The WIND METER — direction as a faceted arrow, speed as a figure | composed by `hud.tsx` beside the altimeter, reading the craft-local bearing and speed from `snapshot.ts`; it says where the sea is coming from, and the sea comes from there (`water-feel`) |
| What the speedo READS | `CraftState.speed` — `|v|`, vertical included; stated once in `engine/game/state.ts`, never re-derived in the HUD |
| The split against the last gate | `Progress.splits` / `lastGatePassedAt` in `engine/game/course.ts` — the HUD shows it, never computes it |
| The run-news flashes, including `MISSED CHECKPOINT` | `pwa/src/game/run-news.ts` chooses from engine events, `strings.ts` owns the words, and `hud.tsx` draws the resulting snapshot |
| The `__SH_READY__` flag the screenshot harness waits on | `App.tsx`, set once the first frame has drawn — a HUD change that delays it is a harness that times out |
| The minimap | `pwa/src/game/minimap-scene.ts` (the coast cut into paths around an ANCHOR, translated to the craft every frame — one ladder of ground heights, each band's edge cut THROUGH the lattice, and `spanNow`'s smoothed window), `minimap-view.ts` (the gates, the chevron, the gauge, the scale bar, the readout), `minimap.tsx` (the glyphs, the two textures and the DOM, including the reduced-motion-safe red pulse around missed gates) — the split above, and `tests/minimap_test.ts` reads the two payload halves without a browser |
| What the map says the shore IS | the bands' paint in `styles.css`: the wood's green and the bare stone over `TREE_LINE` are the WORLD's own (`terrain.ts`, `identity.ts`'s `pine`/`granite`), not a chart palette of their own — a map that invents a colour for the shore is a map that disagrees with what the rider can see |
| The way OUT of a run | Escape, an `InputAction` in `input.ts` that `App.tsx` turns into the front door coming up (`menu-system`) |

## The controls

| Surface | Where |
| --- | --- |
| What a key or a touch MEANS, as maths | `pwa/src/game/input-model.ts` — DOM-free: the throttle ramp, the steer ramp, the lever's drag → throttle curve, the handlebar's travel → steer/lean; `tests/input_model_test.ts` reads it |
| Listening to the DOM | `pwa/src/game/input.ts` — keyboard (W throttle, S/↓ lean back, Shift/↑ lean forward, A/D ←/→ steer, R reset to the last gate, Enter restart, C camera, Escape out to the menu) and the touch zones; nothing here decides, it only feeds the model |
| Touch: the HANDLEBAR overlay | `pwa/src/game/hud-touch.tsx`, LEFT half — thumb travel → steer, vertical travel → lean; drawn as a bar that tilts with the thumb |
| Touch: the THROTTLE LEVER | `hud-touch.tsx`, RIGHT half — the touch anchors at 0, dragging DOWN opens the throttle (full at ~90 px), analogue, held while the finger is down, released on lift; drawn as a lever that follows the thumb |
| A zone's grip on a finger | the thumb-guard discipline in `hud-touch.tsx`: a touch belongs to the zone it STARTED in until it lifts, whatever it wanders over; a second finger on the same half is ignored, not merged |
| A BUTTON pressed while a zone is held | `pwa/src/game/hud-press.ts` — `click` is synthesised from the PRIMARY pointer alone, and a ridden craft has that finger spoken for, so every press drawn over a run fires from `pointerup` and swallows the click behind it; `tests/hud_press_test.ts` reads it |
| The `reset` edge | `CraftInput.reset` is an EDGE — true for one step — and `input-model.ts` is where a held key becomes one |

## The traps

- **The throttle lever drags DOWN, and that is a decision, not an accident.**
  A thumb resting on the lower-right of a phone held sideways pulls toward
  the palm; dragging down is the motion that is easy to hold at speed and
  easy to feather. A lever that opens UPWARD fights the hand. Keep the anchor
  at the touch point (never a fixed on-screen zero), so the lever works
  wherever the thumb lands.
- **Analogue means analogue.** The lever's output is a 0..1 the engine reads
  straight into `throttle`; a keyboard's throttle is RAMPED to 1 in
  `input-model.ts` so a key press does not read as a lever slammed open. Do
  not quantise either.
- **Lean has TWO thumbs.** The handlebar's vertical travel leans on touch;
  S/Shift lean on keys. A HUD change that moves the handlebar's zone changes
  how far a thumb can lean — check `input-model.ts`'s travel-to-lean curve
  still reaches ±1.
- **The HUD reads `GameState` and writes nothing.** No HUD-side timer, no
  HUD-side split arithmetic, no HUD-side "airborne" guess from `y`. If a
  readout needs a number the engine does not expose, the engine grows a
  field (the `engine-system` skill) — never the HUD a formula. **A readout
  that has to OUTLIVE the moment that raised it** — a record held on screen
  after the landing, a warning that lingers — is the same rule wearing a
  clock: the engine publishes WHEN it happened (`progress.bestAirAt` beside
  `bestAir`) and the snapshot compares it against `state.t`. A `useEffect`
  with a `setTimeout` in it is the wrong answer twice over — it does not
  pause with the run and it does not rewind with a reset.
- **The minimap draws in SCREEN space, and that is downstream of ONE flip.**
  `input-model.ts`'s `SCREEN_TO_ENGINE` is the sign boundary; the map's
  projection (`mx = -x`, `my = -z`) and the icon's negated heading are the
  same decision applied to a picture, so a right-hand turn swings the icon
  clockwise. North is up and east is LEFT — the price of agreeing with the
  chase camera, and not a bug to be tidied.
- **THE WHOLE TOP-RIGHT CORNER IS SIZED OFF `--hud-map`, AND THE PRESSES' OWN
  SIZE IS `--hud-press` ON `.hud`** — the diameter and `.hud-zone`'s clearance
  over the cluster read the one number, so a press added to or taken out of the
  row is one edit (`--hud-press`'s divisor and its gap count, one less) and the
  glass below follows. It was written twice before, and the trap was a press
  REMOVED: the button survived with the divisor of the row it used to share and
  nothing looked broken — the marks just came out small with a gap of sea under
  the plate. `.hud-zone`'s sum is the cluster's own terms and must stay
  complete: the inset, the map, `--hud-cluster-gap` (the gap between the map
  and the row) and one press. A term left out of it is glass lying over a
  button, and it is invisible — the zones draw nothing until a thumb is down,
  so the picture shows the button in clear sky either way. Only
  `document.elementFromPoint` down each button's CENTRELINE answers it.
- **A PRESS DRAWN OVER A RUN IS NEVER WIRED ON `onClick` ALONE.** `click` is an
  activation event synthesised from the PRIMARY pointer — the first finger on
  the glass — and on a phone that finger is always the handlebar's or the
  lever's. Every other finger is non-primary and gets `pointerdown` and
  `pointerup` and no click at all, so an `onClick` button over a run is dead
  to exactly the rider who needs it. `hud-press.ts` is the answer and the
  measurement behind it; a new press joins it. Clearance and `z-index` are a
  different question (the zone lesson) and neither one is evidence about the
  other: here the hit test lands, the button hears the touch, and the action
  never runs.
- **The build label is §38's "the running build says what it is".** It reads
  `engine/version.ts` and the build's short hash; do not drop it for room.
- **A new colour on this screen owes the night dressing a ramp.** The HUD dips
  with the craft's lamp — `snapshot.dark` on the root as `--hud-dark`, and the
  block on `.hud` in `styles.css` where every dipped token is a `color-mix` or
  a `calc` along it. Anything added in a literal white or a hard navy is a
  lamp in the corner of a night frame; take it off `--hud-ink`, `--hud-plate`,
  `--hud-edge` or `--hud-track` instead. What stays at full strength is the
  SIGNAL — `--hud-bad` (every warning) and `--hud-good` (the buoy orange, which
  has to agree with the buoys out on the water) — and that is a decision, not
  an oversight.
- **A menu is not a saving.** The menu's backdrop is the real game, ridden by
  the bot — a menu that stops the sea is a bug. That rule and the cards it
  governs are `menu-system`'s; it is restated here because a HUD change that
  reaches into `App.tsx`'s loop can break it from this side.

## The loop

```sh
make build
CHROMIUM_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium make screenshots SCENE=cruise     # the HUD at speed, both viewports
CHROMIUM_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium make screenshots SCENE=launch     # …with the air time up
CHROMIUM_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium make screenshots SCENE=rest       # …at rest, every readout at its floor
CHROMIUM_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium make screenshots SCENE=missed     # …with the miss flash and map pulse
npx vitest run tests/input_model_test.ts                                  # the gestures, headless
```

**`make screenshots` CANNOT SHOW YOU THE TOUCH CONTROLS.** The handlebar and
the lever overlays are anchored under a thumb and only exist while a pointer
is down (`hud-touch.tsx` sets `display: none` on release), and the lab
presses nothing — so a phone shot proves the thumb ZONES are laid out right
and says nothing whatever about the controls drawn in them. A change to
either one is LOOKED at with a scratch probe over the built site instead:
`serveDir("pwa/dist")`, a Chromium context with `hasTouch: true` at
390×844, then `dispatchEvent` a `pointerdown` on `[data-touch="bar"]` (or
`"lever"`) and a `pointermove` to each end of the travel, shooting between
the two and only then sending `pointerup`. `page.touchscreen.tap` will not
do — a tap is down-and-up, and the overlay is gone by the time the shutter
opens. Keep the probe out of the tree when you are done unless it earns a
place on the shelf (`lab-tooling`).

Then run `ui-review`'s audit at the reference viewports (desktop landscape
1280×720, phone portrait 390×844 and phone LANDSCAPE 844×390 — rotation is
not a case you have to remember any more, it is the third shot). A HUD
change is not finished until it has been LOOKED at on a phone-shaped
viewport — the failure mode here is always overlap, clipping, or a control
under a thumb that already has a job: the throttle thumb owns the lower
right, the handlebar thumb the lower left, and no readout that must be
watched mid-turn goes under either.

## What the change obliges elsewhere

- A key or a gesture → `docs/getting-started.md` and the README's Quick
  start; `tests/input_model_test.ts` for the maths. A key that means
  something to a CARD as well goes past `menu-system` too.
- A readout → a scene that photographs it, if none does (`scenarios.ts` +
  `scripts/screenshot.mjs`), and `docs/getting-started.md`.
- Anything the player sees → a `.changes/unreleased/` fragment.

## Skill self-improvement

Load **`skill-reflection`** before this session commits. A settled rule of
thumb about the thumbs — where a zone may reach, what a drag may mean —
belongs in the traps above once it has held twice.
